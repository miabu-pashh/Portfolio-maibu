        <p>
          I am an enthusiastic and driven graduate student of software
          engineering at Saint Louis University, deeply committed to advancing
          my knowledge and skills in computer science. With a rigorous academic
          background, I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer
          Software Engineering, immersing myself in diverse fields such as
          Principles of Software Development, Data Structures Algorithms,
          Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Human-Computer
          Interaction, all of which fuel my passion for cutting-edge
          technologies and innovation.
